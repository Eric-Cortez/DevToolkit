# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

[INFO] Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

`npm start`
Starts the development server.

`npm run build`
Bundles your website into static files for production.

`npm run serve`
Serves the built website locally.

`npm run deploy`
Publishes the website to GitHub pages.

We recommend that you begin by typing:

`cd DevToolkit`
`npm start`

Happy building awesome websites!

`npx docusaurus start`
