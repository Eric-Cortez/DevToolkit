# Semantic HTML Documentation

Semantic HTML involves using HTML tags that carry meaning about the structure and content of a web page. This not only improves accessibility but also aids search engines in understanding the content. Here are some essential semantic elements:

## Common Semantic Elements

### 1. `<header>`

Defines a header for a document or section.

```html
<header>
  <h1>Main Heading</h1>
</header>
```

### 2. `<nav>`

Represents a navigation menu.

```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

```

### 3. `<article>`

Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and reused independently.

```html
<article>
  <h2>Article Title</h2>
  <p>Article content goes here.</p>
</article>

```

### 4. `<article>`

Defines a section in a document.

```html
<section>

  <p>Section content goes here.</p>
</section>
```

### 5. `<footer>`

### Benefits of Semantic HTML

1) Accessibility: Semantic HTML improves accessibility for users with disabilities, as screen readers can better interpret the content.
2) SEO-Friendly: Search engines understand the structure and hierarchy of content, enhancing search engine optimization.
3) Maintainability: Semantic code is easier to understand and maintain, promoting a clean and organized codebase.

By incorporating these semantic elements, you can create well-structured, accessible, and SEO-friendly web pages.
