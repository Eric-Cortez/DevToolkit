Web accessibility, or eAccessibility, is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. Correctly designed and developed sites provide equal access to information and functionality.

For example, well-coded HTML, meaningful text equivalents for images, and named links benefit users with various disabilities. Accessibility considerations include large text and images, underlined and differentiated links for color-blind users, clickable areas designed for users with poor motor control, keyboard-friendly navigation, closed captioning for videos, and avoiding flashing effects for users prone to seizures.
