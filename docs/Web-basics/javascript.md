# JavaScript Basics

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is commonly used for building dynamic and interactive websites. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, understanding the basics of JavaScript is essential for web development.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamic content on web pages. It is a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs in the user's web browser, allowing for interactive and responsive user experiences.

## Getting Started

To start using JavaScript in your web projects, you have a few options:

1. **Inline Scripting:**
   You can include JavaScript code directly within your HTML file using the `<script>` tag. For example:
   ```html
   <script>
     // Your JavaScript code goes here
   </script>
   ```

### External Script File

For better organization, you can create a separate JavaScript file (e.g., script.js) and link it to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

### Browser Console

You can also experiment with JavaScript in your browser's console. Simply open the browser console (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect") and navigate to the "Console" tab.

### Basic Syntax

JavaScript code consists of statements, which are executed sequentially. Here's a simple example:

```js
// Variables
let greeting = "Hello, ";
let name = "John";

// Concatenation
let message = greeting + name;

// Displaying the message
console.log(message);
```

### Data Types

JavaScript supports various data types, including:

```
- Strings: 'Hello', "World"
- Numbers: 42, 3.14
- Booleans: true, false
- Objects: { key: 'value' }
- Arrays: ['apple', 'orange', 'banana']
```

### Control Flow

JavaScript provides control flow statements to make decisions and control the flow of execution. Examples include:

```js
// If statement
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if the condition is false
}

// Looping (for loop)
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // Code to repeat five times
}
```
