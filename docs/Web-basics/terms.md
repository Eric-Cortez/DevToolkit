# Web Development Glossary


Welcome to the glossary section! In the realm of web development, this glossary serves as a handy reference guide, offering concise explanations of key terms and concepts utilized in the field. It is designed to assist in comprehending and becoming acquainted with the terminology employed throughout the documentation.

- **IDE** : An **Integrated Development Environment** is a software suite that integrates essential tools for coding, testing, and debugging within a unified platform, enhancing developer productivity and streamlining the development workflow.

- **REPL**: A **Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)** is an interactive programming environment that allows users to input commands, have them executed, and receive immediate feedback. It's a powerful tool for testing, exploring code snippets, and quickly iterating during development.

- **Open Source Software**: Software whose source code is freely available to the public. Users can view, modify, and distribute the code, fostering collaboration and transparency within the development community.

- **Proprietary Software**: Closed-source software where the source code is not publicly available. Users typically obtain the software through a license and do not have the right to view or modify the underlying code. The development and distribution are controlled by the software's owner or organization.

- **SFTP: Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)**: Aa secure and encrypted file transfer protocol that provides a secure method for transferring files over a network. SFTP operates over SSH (Secure Shell) and ensures the confidentiality and integrity of data during the file transfer process. It's commonly used for secure and reliable file sharing between systems.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A visual interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices or software through graphical elements such as icons, buttons, and windows. GUIs provide an intuitive and user-friendly way to navigate and control applications, making it easier for users to perform tasks without relying on command-line instructions.


- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: A text-based interface that enables users to interact with software and computer systems by typing commands into a terminal or command prompt. Unlike GUIs, CLIs require users to input text commands to execute tasks. While CLIs may seem less visually intuitive, they often provide more control and efficiency for users familiar with command-line operations.

- **Version Control**: A system that manages changes to source code or any set of files, allowing multiple contributors to collaborate on a project simultaneously. It tracks modifications, facilitates collaboration, and helps in maintaining a chronological history of changes. Version control systems like Git provide features such as branching, merging, and rollback, ensuring effective collaboration and code management.


- **Debugging**: The process of identifying and resolving errors, defects, or unexpected behavior in software code. Developers use debugging tools and techniques to trace and fix issues in their programs, ensuring that the code functions correctly. Debugging involves activities like setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and analyzing program flow to locate and eliminate bugs or issues in the code.

- **Cloud-Based Hosting**: refers to the practice of hosting websites, applications, or services on virtual servers that are part of a cloud computing infrastructure. Instead of relying on a single physical server, cloud hosting utilizes a network of interconnected servers distributed across various locations. This approach provides scalability, flexibility, and reliability, allowing users to scale resources based on demand. Popular cloud hosting providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
